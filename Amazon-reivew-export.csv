5.0 out of 5 stars,Chinmay Pandey,https://www.amazon.in/gp/customer-reviews/R2PFLRX1OTRU4A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B08XMB4Z77, Just buy it.,"I purchased this within one month of its launch and it gets out of stock very quickly
Pros :
Ryzen 5 5500U ( 6cores, 12Threads, Zen2 architecture ) paired with 1650 can get all of your work done. If you need more, you should be looking for laptops above 80k ( or desktop )
Screen is good enough, cannot ask for more in this price range.
Body is made up of plastic but keyboard deck is made up of aluminium for heat dissipation.
Excellent palm rejection from touchpad and the size is good enough to get everything done. External keyboard and mouse will be better anyway.
I/O is fair for this price range.
Excellent ventilation, both in terms of intake and exhaust.
Barely noticeable fan noise while doing less processing intensive work. Given hot ambient temperature during summer in India, laptop fans will make noticeable noise but it is not a sharp annoying whine. You will not feel any type of discomfort with that noise.
Backlit keyboard is good for dark rooms.
Linux dual boot will also run fine provided you install it properly and configure nVidia drivers ( GTX 1650 will bug you A LOT during live boot but you can access command line interface and install your distro ). Remove nouveau drivers and install proprietary drivers for best performance.
A lot of things can be tweaked from BIOS ( Fn+F1/F2 idk , for first time users ) including the timeout enable/disable for keyboard backlight so make sure to check bios settings if you're into those things. (To access secure boot, you need to set supervisor password)
Battery backup is actually around 6.5 hours for new machine for continuous video playback and if you're barely doing any work like reading documents/PDF files then it can last for 14 hours easily.

Cons :
Laptop body can extract your fingerprints better than national crime investigation departments. Also it can get scratches very easily so be careful.
Do not apply too much pressure on hinge. Although it can last for years, it all boils down to how the end user treats it.

Side notes :
Upgrade RAM by adding another 8GB stick or replace the RAM with 2 16GB sticks (SO-DIMM DDR4 3200MHz ). No, 12/24 GB configuration will definitely work but it cannot give you max Dual Channel performance since dual channel tech works efficiently when both memory module are of same capacity. So either buy 1 8GB stick or get 2 16GB ones. (Max 32GB for this system)
Get an external 1TB type C SSD. it's better than replacing internal 512GB nvme with 1TB.
Keyboard area can get warm under full load but nothing to worry about. You should use external keyboard and mouse if you're using your system this much anyway.

TL;DR : if your budget is 55k max and you want a laptop that is worth the amount, there is nothing better than this so far.
Reviewed after 15 days of usage.

I'm a computer professional and I've used at least 5 laptops and 8 different desktops during my career. I can say that this is the single most performant laptop I've ever used. Windows 10 performance and smoothness is noticable. Perfect for WFH/software developement. Simply beautiful machine and I think you'll love it.

Pros:
- great build quality, does not feel like cheap Compaq laptops
- sturdy and rigid, good quality hinge
- excellent cooling, cpu stays 50-60 degrees Celsius even under heavy load
- excellent performance with Ryzen 5 chip
- stock 8gb Ram works fine
- Screen - full Hd screen is very clear and crisp (my photos could not capture the quality)
- Screen colour gamut is very impressive, works fine for graphics design, stunning colours
- dark gray laptop skin looks very pro and cool
- keyboard touch is wonderful
- you need to change DPI to 100% to take advantage of full HD
- 3 normal size USB ports
- physical Ethernet Jack for high speed internet

Cons
- Speakers bass is worse than my OnePlus phone
- Speakers sound a bit tinpot (its perfect if you are using headphones)
- You'll need external speakers to watch movies with family with good quality audio
- speaker rating 5/10
- audio jack rating 10/10

Overall rating 9/10","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/A1VWxuKQBGL._SY88.jpg

Don't buy for more than 55k.
Been using it for a week and it's been a silent but deadly beast. No frills, just great specs. Handles most AAA titles at ultra high considerably well. Perfect for casual gamers.

One thing I found confusing though was Acer marking this at an MRP of 80k+ and the same model with 16 GB RAM at 69k.
8 GB 3200MHz chips are in the market for around 4k, 16 GB for 8k, so a memory upgrade shouldn't be too costly relatively.",,"https://images-eu.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,1024,1024_SX48_.png",Reviewed in India ???? on 27 March 2021

Only problem is that there is only 8gb of ram and even though it is enough for gaming, it is in single channel that's why because of ram limitations, games that run at 30 fps on ultra run at only 40 fps at medium. There will be very little performance gains going from ultra to even low. So I suggest that if you get this laptop offline, spend the extra cash and upgrade the ram to dual channel and it will increase the longevity of the laptop by a huge margin",,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/x-locale/common/grey-pixel.gif,Reviewed in India ???? on 17 March 2022

Was previously using a Toshiba c640 with i3 2nd generation processor which I had picked up way back in 2011.

Personally was looking for a laptop top which I can use for office use as well as mid level gaming and also one which I can possibly use for atleast 8 to 10 years. ( i don't believe in buying an expensive laptop , using it just for a couple of years and discarding it. Absolutely waste of money)

I am very happy with the built quality. Booting speed is great, less than 10 seconds. Display quality is pretty decent. Laptop doesn't heat up at all with you regular day to day work and with browsing. Can hardly hear the fan running.

Though while gaming it does heat up a bit and the fans do become a little noisy.

Battery is pretty decent lasts for a good 4 to 5hrs with 80 % charge.

Extremely satisfied and happy with my purchase as I got a decent deal for a very good laptop. Hopefully it lasts for long .",,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/x-locale/common/grey-pixel.gif,Reviewed in India ???? on 25 July 2021
